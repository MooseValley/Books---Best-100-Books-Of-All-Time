# Books - Best 100 Books Of All Time

This is some old code I wrote back in back in 2014 to try and determine the "Best 100 Books Of All Time".

I grabbed top 100 lists from all round the internet - wherever I could find a list.
And then used my program to try and pull out the book authors and titles into a list and then try and count the number of times each book appeared in a list.

And then compare this top 100 list against a huge list of eBooks I had.

From memory (Nov-2020), it was all working well ...

When I found the top 100, my plan was to read "Best 100 Books Of All Time".

From memory (Nov-2020), I think the problem was that I had already a bunch of the books on the resulting top 100 list, and I didn't think they were that great at all.
The same names kept cropping up on lists again and again ... and, imho, the books were overrated shit.

So there you go ... the source code is here and some of the lists ...  just in case anyone can make use of it.
