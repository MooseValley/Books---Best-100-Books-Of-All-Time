# Books - Best 100 Books Of All Time

### Borland Delphi v2-v5

My Delphi code from Sep-2014 to try and determine a definitive list of the "Best 100 Books Of All Time".

I grabbed top 100 books lists from all round the internet - wherever I could find a list.  And then used my program to pull out the book authors and titles into a list and then try and count the number of times each book appeared in a list.

And then I also compared this top 100 list against a huge list of eBooks I had, to see which books were available in eBook form.

My code uses statistical keyword searching / matching to try and determine the best match between book lists - because the titles, authors, etc are NOT consistent across lists.  e.g. "J.R.R. Tolkien, Lord of the Rings Trilogy", "Tolkien, J.R.R. - The Lord of the Rings (trilogy)", etc.

From memory (Nov-2020), it was all working really well ...

When I found the top 100, my plan was to read "Best 100 Books Of All Time", and also place the Top 100 list on my web site.

From memory (Nov-2020), I spent several weeks or more on this (part-time) - gathering lists, fine tuning my code, etc ...

From memory (Nov-2020), the problem was that when I had a pretty clear "Top 100" list (the same books were coming up again and again), then I noticed with dismay that I had actually already read a bunch of the books in the resulting top 100 list, and I didn't think many of them were that great at all.  Not going to mention any names here ... but even many in the resulting "Top 10" would not qualify for my personal "Top 10,000" list.  The same names kept cropping up on lists again and again ... and, in my humble opinion, the books were overrated and pretty shit.  Obviously, if a "top book critic" say a book is good, then others just agree with them.

So I sort of lost interest in trying to determine the definitive Top 100 ...

Just read the books you want !

So there you go ... the source code is here and some of the lists ...  just in case anyone can make use of it.
