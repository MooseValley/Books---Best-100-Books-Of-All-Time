Below are the BBC’s top 100 books. Comment and share how many books from this list you have read and books that you think should be on this list.

The BBC has an esteemed list of books they think every person should read before they die. A bucket list of literature, if you will. So get checking … how many of this list have you already tackled? Are any on your own personal “to-read list?” And are there any on the list you think shouldn’t even be on it? Keep in mind this list may be a little bit biased, being from the BBC and all.

Dave This must be a dynamic list. I printed it several years ago and started reading them and checking them off. Comparing it with this list there are numerous differences. I'm enjoying the reads anyway, up to 75. this difference will just give me that many more to read

It's been doing the rounds on Facebook, in the UK at least, for several years; this is the third or fourth time I've responded to it in some form.

Though I feel like I should get some partial credit for a few others for which I've "only seen the movie" (sometimes multiple VERSIONS of the movie), a few that I've re-read a number of times, and a few that I've only partly read (How many people have read many or most of the Shakespeare plays but not the full canon, the same goes for the Bible)

BTW why is Frank Herbert's first volume of the Dune chronicles on the list rather than the full series?

    honestly, this is a solid list, and I have legitimately read most of them unlike most of the other critics. this is a good list and obviously there are other contenders, but the "100" kind of limits it. And for the record there is a reason the "stuffy classics" are classics. they are excellent, timeless pieces of literature. and if you don't want to read them then don't but you're missing out on some amazing literature for nothing. this is a great list of art and if you disagree then write your own. these are merely quality suggestions. I'm sorry if your favorite book isn't on here but give these books a chance- any one of them might become your new favorite book.

    I'm surprised that Russian literature is presented only by three authors. What are the criteria for selecting these novels?

    I've read seven books on this list and those are among my favorites. this list is very agreeable even though I have yet to read all the book mentioned, I've been very much aware of them all and have been intending to read them in the near future.

    If it were my list I would include a couple biographies.

    The omission of D. H. Lawrence is a massive oversight in my opinion but very very pleased to see Jane Eyre so high up.

    Really a terrific list. Just read If on a Winter's Night a Traveller(great) and then I see it on this list. I wonder how many other books on the list I will end up loving. Also,I never see Knut Hamsun on these lists. (He is my favorite.)Can anyone tell me if it's because of his political affiliations or do people just not love his books?

    We also need some Faulkner on this list. ABSALOM, ABSALOM perhaps, maybe LIGHT IN AUGUST or AS I LAY DYING.



    And no A TALE OF TWO CITIES or GREAT EXPECTATIONS? What about OLIVER TWIST or DAVID COPPERFIELD?

    Good to see Camus in there. However, Ulysses is too low in the list, as is Great Gatsby. Where is Fiesta? The Sound and the Fury? A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man? In Cold Blood? A Clockwork Orange? The Heart is a Lonely Hunter?

    Just reading through the comments I find that some people aren't really reading the list. I saw several complaining about the lack of Dickens and Fitzgerald, both of which are on the list. Also read those asking about Huck Finn, which is also on the list.



    I am a little disappointed that there was no Gone with the Wind on the list. I was also suprised that there was no Hemingway.

    The list writer (committee?) exhibits a disjointed, idiosyncratic intellect. Eugene Onegin is great RUSSIAN literature, but best read in Russian. War & Peace, on the other hand, is world class regardless of language. Updike and his rabbit over Hemingway and Fitzgerald? Simply purile.

    I know every list contains an inherent BIAS, but I think an attempt to scale works of literature in such a way as to rank them according to 'worth' or 'greatness' is both presumptuous and really, quite stupid.

    Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Should be in the top twenty at least. Maybe even top ten, yet he has no books in the top 100 at all. That alone makes this list utterly bogus. Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five should both make an appearance here but for some reason they're omitted. Can someone explain to me how this is possible? I'll except a good explanation and maybe put faith in this list.

    The Alexandria Quartet, by Lawrence Durrell. The only book(s) I have read three times and which I would gladly read again. Maybe not Top 10, but certainly worth 10-20.



    Anna Karenina should be number one, and Middlemarch number two.

    I'm surprised there's nothing there by Anthony Trollope.



    "The Way We Live Now." is the most stunning novel. Its a tale of Victorian power, passion and corruption that is as relevant now as then. The rise and fall of Augustus Malotte, a notorious swindler and scoundrel is the central character of the novel. This is a very different Trollope who wrote about Barchester.

    Very Anglo-Centric. Where are the great Russian writers? How about Alexander Solzhenitsyn? His novels, Cancer Ward and The First Circle, both remain memorable 30 years later, now that my own empire--USSA--becomes more and more totalitarian. More appropos than a saptain's obsession with a white whale. No offense to whalers or Greenpeace of course.

    Reading people's comments is always more entertaining than the list itself; all anyone ever does is tick off the ones they have read and, if they don't find enough of their personal favourites to feel suitably smug, then denounce the compiler.



    Pedantic point but this isn't really even a 100 books is it. Hitchhikers guide is 5, A dance to the Music of Time is 10 or 11, there are at least 3 Rabbit Books maybe more and you could even argue that Lord of the Rings is 3 not 1. Same goes for A La Recherche.

    Hooray for the person who said ask your local librarian for book suggestions rather than rely on a list compiled by some anonymous person/entity. A librarian will ask you what you have read that you like, what you are looking for, and guide you to books to complement and stretch your reach. S/he will have a conversation with you to find out what works for you. No list is good for everyone,as evidenced by the widely varying suggestions posted here. Far better to rely on personal recommendations.

    This would certainly not be my list of "must read" books, even though I have read many of them. Several are the same kind of crap that you have to read in English and other literature college classes, but just because the literary elite says they are "must reads" does not mean they are necessarliy good reading.



    I do agree on "Pride & Prejudice" by Jane Austen ;)

    I consider myself an avid reader, yet I have read none of these books. Does that make my reading career totally worthless? And should we read a book because some guy in a stuffy library says it's a classic? I ask where are the John Sauls and the Dean Koontzs? And what about the Jonathan Kellermans or the Patricia Cornwells? There is so much more out there than the stuffy classics. Broaden your scope of what is good literature!

4. Up From Slavery by Booker T. Washington – This 1901 autobiography provides thought changing insights into what it was like to be a man raised as a child slave who later strives to make a mark on American history. A true lesson about black history after the Civil War.

3. Ulysses by James Joyce – A heavy read that people seem to either love or hate due to Joyce’s experimental prose. Yet this novel is consistently in the top ranks of “must reads” because of the masterful way Joyce crafts a 650 story where all of the events take place within a single day.

2. 1984 by George Orwell – A 1949 novel that is sure to receive greater attention in our present age of terrorism. Orwell’s themes about a society defined by perpetual wars, heavy government surveillance, thought control and an oppressive dictatorship have proven to become a harsh reality in many countries throughout the world since 9/11.

1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald – Widely regarded to be the prime example of the Great American Novel. Fitzgerald’s soaring tale about American society during the spring to autumn of 1922 exemplifies the meaning of storytelling at its best.

            One of my favorites was D.H. Lawrence – Sons and Lovers. Amazing love story about a boy who loves a girl but has a hard time doing so because he couldn’t break away from his over-bearing mother. Some of the quotes in the book he uses to describe love is just incredible.

            And of the course James Joyce, Dubliners. 15 short stories about all the issues of Ireland during the early 20th century. One of the main reasons why James Joyce is one my favorites.

Amazon has just released a list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime. This is a curation by Amazon Books editorial team of 100 books you must read before you die.

What makes this list interesting is that it spans decades, continents, and a range between fiction and non-fiction work. The oldest book on the list, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, was published in 1813. Kate Atkinson’s Life after Life, published in 2013, was the most recent on the list. The Amazon Books editorial team plans to regularly audit the list to ensure the list’s cultural relevance.

According to Sara Nelson, Amazon.com’s Editorial Director of Print and Kindle, “We listed the book alphabetically by title because our assumption is that no book is more important than another.”

Trimmed and Tiddied up list by Moose O'Malley:
FARENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury -> Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
----------------------------------------------


Since the “100 Best” story first broke in The New York Times on Monday, July 20, 1998, all kinds of opinions about the list – and theories about the Modern Library’s purpose in concocting such a contest of sorts – emerged.

The goal of the “100 Best” project was to get people talking about great books. We succeeded beyond our wildest imaginings — more than 400,000 avid readers rushed online to cast votes for their favorite books and the students of the Radcliffe Publishing Course quickly responded with rival list of 100 Best Novels.

The reader’s poll for the best nonfiction published in the English language since 1900 opened on April 29, 1999 and closed on September 30, 1999 with a total of 194,829 votes cast.

The readers’ poll for the best novels published in the English language since 1900 opened on July 20, 1998 and closed on October 20, 1998, with 217,520 votes cast.

To jumpstart your own, more structured discussion of the books, try using a few talking points as a guide.

The World Library is a list of the 100 best books, as proposed by one hundred writers from fifty-four different countries, compiled and organized in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club. This list endeavors to reflect world literature, with books from all countries, cultures, and time periods.

Each writer had to select his or her own list of ten books. The books selected by this process and listed here are not ranked or categorized in any way; the organizers have stated that "they are all on an equal footing," with the exception of Don Quixote which was given the distinction "best literary work ever written." The following list organizes the works alphabetically by author.[1]

Fyodor Dostoevsky is the author with the most books on the list, with four. William Shakespeare, Franz Kafka, and Leo Tolstoy each have three books on the list.

Breakdown by language, gender

Eleven of the books included on the list are written by women, eighty-five are written by men and four have unknown authors. This breakdown is similar to other lists, such as Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century, which was voted for by 17,000 people from the general public and contains twelve books by women.

Twenty-six of the one hundred voting writers had English as their first language,[2] which may be a factor in the list having so many (29) books written in English. Again, this phenomenon was visible in Le Monde's list, with 49 French books.

    The Top 100, a bucket list, books you'd save in a fire, the best books, evah!

    Whatever it's called we love a list of what we think are the best books of all time so we've compiled an entirely arbitrary and personal selection of 100 titles below for you to disagree with.

    As we can hear the howls of outrage - "What!? You’re kidding!". We would love to know what you’d put in the big list. So, at the bottom of our list we've left a little space for you to tell us up to five of your favourite books we've missed that absolutely, definitively, profoundly, irresistibly, must, must, must go in and we'll put your collective wisdom up in a new list along with a selection of your reasons why.

TIME - All-TIME 100 Novels

Critics Lev Grossman and Richard Lacayo pick the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923—the beginning of TIME.

By Richard Lacayo Jan. 06, 2010222 Comments
Best Books of ALL TIME: 100 Novels

Welcome to the massive, anguished, exalted undertaking that is the ALL TIME 100 books list. The parameters: English language novels published anywhere in the world since 1923, the year that TIME Magazine began, which, before you ask, means that Ulysses (1922) doesn’t make the cut. In May, Time.com posted a similar list, of 100 movies picked by our film critics, Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel. This one is chosen by me, Richard Lacayo, and my colleague Lev Grossman, whom we sometimes cite as proof that you don’t need to be named Richard to be hired as a critic at TIME, though apparently it helps. Just ask our theater critic, Richard Zoglin.

For the books project, Grossman and I each began by drawing up inventories of our nominees. Once we traded notes, it turned out that more than 80 of our separately chosen titles matched. (Even some of the less well-known ones, like At-Swim Two Birds.) We decided then that we would more or less divide the remaining slots between us. That would allow each of us to include books that the other might not have chosen. Or might not even have read. (Ubik? What’s an Ubik?) And that would extend the list into places where mere agreement wouldn’t take it.

Even so, there are many titles we couldn’t fit here that we’re still anguishing over. Djuna Barnes’ Nightwood dropped in and out. Aldous Huxley’s Point Counter Point hovered for a while at the edges. There were writers we had to admit we love more for their short stories than their novels—Donald Barthelme, Annie Proulx, Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty. We could agree that some of Gore Vidal’s novels are an essential pleasure, but it’s his non-fiction that’s essential period. Then there was the intellectual massif of Norman Mailer, indisputably one of the great writers of our time, but his supreme achievements are his headlong reconfigurations of the whole idea of non-fiction, books like Armies of the Night and The Executioner’s Song. Dawn Powell, Mordechai Richler, Thomas Wolfe, Peter Carey, J.F. Powers, Mary McCarthy, Edmund White, Larry McMurtry, Katherine Ann Porter, Amy Tan, John Dos Passos, Oscar Hijuelos—we looked over our bookcases and many more than 100 names laid down a claim. This means you, Stephen King.

This project, which got underway in January, was not just a reading effort. It was a re-reading effort. It meant revisiting a lot of novels both of us had not looked into for some time. A few titles that seemed indispensable some years ago turned out on a second tasting to be, well, dispensable. More common was the experience I had with Saul Bellow’s Herzog, about a man coming to terms with the disappointments of midlife by directing his questions everywhere. It was one of the first adult novels I attempted in late adolescence. It left its treadmarks on me even then, but this time his experienced heart spoke to me differently.

There were also first time discoveries. Having heard for years that Richard Yates’ Revolutionary Road was one of the great but underappreciated American novels, I searched it out. I have spent the months since then pressing it into the hands of anybody who will take it, including yours. Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale Hurston’s great story of a black woman surviving whatever God and man throws at her, was not part of the required reading list when I was in school. It is now part of my personal canon. Henry Green? Hadn’t read Henry Green. Finally read Loving. Loved it.

Lists like this one have two purposes. One is to instruct. The other of course is to enrage. We’re bracing ourselves for the e-mails that start out: “You moron! You pathetic bourgeoise insect! How could you have left off…(insert title here).” We say Mrs. Dalloway. You say Mrs. Bridge. We say Naked Lunch. You say Breakfast at Tiffanys. Let’s call the whole thing off? Just the opposite—bring it on. Sometimes judgment is best formed under fire. But please, no e-mails about Ulysses. Rules are rules.

At first I thought this was  Stone’s variation on the term Kant invented to describe the noumenal world, “the thing in itself.”That is, how something exists in and of itself apart from human perception of it.

"GONE WITH THE WIND" could be viewed as an entertaining book for the masses.  But I would never view it as great.  I'm not simply complaining about the racism and sexism it supports, but I found its narrative structure somewhat weak.  The story starts out as a historical drama with an undertone of melodrama.  In the second half, the historical aspects of the story is tossed out of the window and story becomes mired into a marital melodrama.

I think the list is for good to read books not "Books for Snobs". I don't always want to read a book and then have to reread it just to make sure it get it. I don't need 'deep' books all the time. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and escape for awhile. So why isn't Jack Vance on this list. Talk about entertaining, what a hoot!

Gone With The Wind??? The Grand Old South??? So it's quintessentially American - like "Mein Kampf" is quintessentially German?  (For the record, I tried reading this some 25 years ago. The appalling condescension it displayed towards its black characters proved too much for me, and I stopped somewhere around page 60. One "adorable" example I remember is how Negroes, children and animals see through Mr. O'Hara's bluster, and understand he's really a softie.)

@SeanLedden 

Then you'll hate Portnoy's complaint for it's main character's racist hatred of other religions and ethnic groups and women.  You'll also hate The heart is a lonely hunter for it's racist views of evil white characters and good black characters.  The same is true of Song of Solomon and The color purple but those are poorly written books.

Perhaps you should avoid books that are sure not to offend (or excite) you.

I'm surprised to see so many people saying Harry Potter belongs on this list...that is laughable to me. Harry Potter is decent enough for 13 year olds to get into reading, but as far as calling it a classic piece of literature that will be read for hundreds of years? Doubtful. Harry Potter is not some deep, profound literature...you can take everything at face value in HP. It's popular sure, but so is Twilight. And DON'T tell me that belongs on here.

I have abused my meager intellect on this type of list before.So, I took a different approach.Going in, if I had read more than five percent of the books on the list, I would rank myself as a pathetic sot.Well the bad news is that I have read 12 or twelve percent.That makes me either a sot or pathetic but hopefully not both.


I believe Time-Life has offered The Reading Program more than once.Well, I got in one iteration and was introduced to number of books that would have never made it my way without the program.So, half way through perusing the Time’s All-Time 100 Novels, I thought it would be interesting to compare the books in the Reading Program vs. the list of 100.Wait, many of the books in the Reading Program were published prior to 1923 or were first written in another language.The exercise would be pointless.


Truthfully, I have not read all the books put into the reading program.Some I dumped after a few chapters due to the yawn factor.If asked, would I purchase the program again – the answer would be a vigorous yes.The value of the books that I have read is too great to feel bad about the books I have yet and may never read in the program.However, none of the books in the 100 list got me going to the bookstore for a copy.


There were a few authors I have read, for example Philip Roth and Saul Bellow.The choice of titles did not sync with what I have read of their work.With my twelve percent hit rate on the list my ranking them as excellent authors probably does not mean much.


Now I am at the end of the list and pondering the importance of including two of Steinbeck’s books and only one of Hemmingway’s.I can understand not including “The Old Man and The Sea” since this is a mere sketch of a book when compared to a full blown novel.However, the old man, in my mind better captures the essential Hemmingway than any of his books.I am lost.What can be done with this list?Can I pass it to a young adult?If they read say fourteen of the books.Does that make them a better person or more well read?


I actually chuckled when I saw Raymond Chandler on the list.I think I have read nearly every book he published and had fun reading every one.So, how could Chandler be included in the list and Walter Mosley was left off?Neither author made the Reading Program in my time.I did go back and count spines, 37 in total.Two jumped off the shelf.“Reveille in Washington” by Margaret Leach.In hind sight I would reread Reveille three times vs. reading Bruce Catton’s Civil War three volumes.One of my all-time favorites “Voice at the Back Door” by Elizabeth Spencer would not make the list, it was 7 years premature.


I scanned the comments following the list and noticed multiple references to Harry Potter.I am puzzled. Hopefully I will write this correctly.In that I respect the judgment of younger generations, but may not appreciate it.Harry Potter has not really spoken to me.However, I would have given up multiple titles from the same author for more contemporary titles.Maybe, one of these 88 titles would have caught my eye vs. the ones on the list that didn’t.


H. L Mencken was if anything the critic’s critic.To paraphrase him, an idea no matter how preposterous will come to be fact if propounded long enough.In this age of the internet, our greatest asset, younger generations, are at risk of being pummeled in ad finum.Even though Mencken met the criteria of the list, written in English and published after 1923, luckily he did not make the cut.We can only hope that the sheer volume of data on the net will give the Time’s All-Time 100 Novels a proper burial.

What?  All Quiet on the Western Front is not on this list?  Time does not know a great book when they read it!  This book by Remarque should be at least in the top 50 for greatest war story ever told, but instead they have war stories of less caliber, like Atonement.  Did you know Remarque's book, All Quiet on the Western Front, is actually the most gripping of works written almost in its entirety in first person present?

It's funny, for this list to have any real meaning to people they must be quite well read, or at least be looking for something to read.  Yet from the comments below, it seems very few people actually READ the description at the top of the page.


"100 best ENGLISH-language novels published since 1923—the beginning of TIME."  Maybe part of the confusion is that their use of "TIME" is referring to the magazine as a play on words?  Of course, if that has you confused, don't bother reading anything on this list as you're sure to miss the point!

Frank Herbert's Dune (not as good as Stranger, but superior to Lord of the Rings)

As a fan of satire, I must protest the exclusion of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho.


And finally, as a fan of gonzo journalism, I must protest the exclusion of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream.

It's an interesting list to see. Must've been hard to choose these books, in particular which books by P. Roth. I seem to be missing any work by D. Coupland, however. 'Generation X' may be the most well-known, but some of his other books might even be better ('Hey, Nostradamus', 'Girlfriend in a Coma'). 

Apart from other suggestions in the comments, Y. Martel's 'Life of Pi' needs be considered for such a list, in my opinion. I'd personally like to have seen Asimov's 'I, Robot' in this list as well. It may basically be a collection of short stories (someone in this comments section pointed out a lot of SF novels shouldn't have been extended beyond being short stories), but it contains a lot that may actually be, or become, relevant, e.g. what rules should robots, if they ever come to existence, obey? What problems could still follow from these rules?

Well you've got it wrong haven't you. Where is the chick-lit and Harry Potter? You've got absolutely no representation for modern classics, and granted those aren't going to be making any school reading lists anytime soon, but they are truly excellent books, and you can't tell me you wouldn't want to take Harry Potter through some world-devasatating event so the children on the other side had some truly great literature to read. Besides Narnia is all veiled propaganda for the Church and that's biased. Harry Potter is better because there's no religious preference.

@disgruntledchicklitlover It is worth noting that most lists like this are going to be at least 20 years out of date given who tends to write them, if not more - most such lists are heavily biased towards books that the people who assembled the lists read in school. Maybe by 2040 we'll be able to make a reasonable list of the best novels of the 20th century.


That being said, Harry Potter doesn't belong on the list. Popularity and greatness are two different things; there are many, many very popular novels which have existed over time, but very few of them were great - they were easily consumed and forgotten. The Lord of the Rings will be better remembered in 2100 than Harry Potter.


Harry Potter is a sort of pulp fiction - easily read and easily forgotten. Great novels endure.


In a hundred years, I think people will find things like The Giver far more interesting than Harry Potter.

@disgruntledchicklitlover Don't think that Grossman isn't a fan of Harry Potter. If you've read his Magician's series it is very evident that he's a fan. Putting modern books on lists like this are difficult though because in order to be a truly great piece of literature then they have to endure. It's hard to tell what books will be popular in 20 years, especially since many books are sleeper hits. Many of the classics that we have now weren't popular when they first came out. It's the nature of making subtle art.

2 guys are not going to pick novels that resonate with females, I thought. And yeah, mostly male authors and mostly what has been called the canon, heritage picks. 


A favorite of mine however dealing with existential position of women in historical context, "The French Lieutenant's Woman", was included. Thanks for that. The technique of the male focus was a delicious irony.


I just reread Gatsby after reading Ignacious's update "The Sun King." Liked Ignacious's better. But on the theme of obsessive love "Lolita" tops them both. Fitzgerald is lightweight. Nabokov is heavy duty.


I love Chandler and Hammett, read everything they wrote, but when it comes to writers transcending the detective genre P.D. James is better, as is Elmore Leonard, who could carry a story almost entirely in snappy dialogue. Loved "Pagan Babies" and "Cuba Libre". 


I love LeCarre but would have picked different--"Tailor of Panama", "Perfect Spy," "Absolute Friends" because of characterization and wit. 


Atwood is underrepresented and the choice off. "Handmaid's Tale" was powerful and topical, and "Cat's Eye" brilliant. Structurally it appears to climax about 2/3s in, yet the brilliance of the writing carries the reader on to the end. 


And where is Kingsolver? The epic "Poisonwood Bible" or my fav "Animal Dreams"?


Agree about Dreiser's novel. A long time favorite of mine. Didn't know it was written that late into the last century.


I have more but I also have a life. Thanks for the op to sound off.

So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives, we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of favorites. What do you think? How did we do? Tell us on Goodreads, where you can vote and add your own selections.
